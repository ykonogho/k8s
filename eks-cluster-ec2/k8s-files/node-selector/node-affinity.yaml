# In this example, replace <label-key> with the actual key of the label you want to match on the node, and <label-value> 
# with the desired value of that label. The operator: In specifies an exact match for the label value. 
# You can also use other operators like NotIn, Exists, DoesNotExist, etc., based on your requirements.

# When you create or apply this pod definition, Kubernetes will only consider nodes that have the specified label key-value pair for scheduling the pod.
# Nodes without the required label will be excluded from consideration.

# Remember that node affinity is just one of the many factors that Kubernetes considers during scheduling, and 
# it's not a strict guarantee. Other factors like resource availability, node conditions, and pod anti-affinity rules can still affect 
# the final scheduling decision.

# Run the command "kubectl label nodes node_name key=value" to label a node prior to running hte pod
